It is a fundamental technology for web development, working alongside HTML (which provides the structure of a webpage) and JavaScript (which adds interactivity).

It uses tags to define content elements like headings, paragraphs, and images, and tells a web browser how to display them. HTML is the foundational building block of the web, working alongside CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. </p>
